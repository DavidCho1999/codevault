9.7.3. 
Performance of Windows, Doors and Skylights 
9.7.3.1. 
General Performance Criteria 
(1) Except as provided in Sentences (2) to (4), windows, doors and skylights and their components separating 
conditioned space from unconditioned space or the exterior shall be designed, constructed and installed so that, when in 
the closed position, they 
 
(a) 
resist the ingress of precipitation into interior space, (See Note A-9.7.4.2.(1)) 
 
(b) resist wind loads, 
 
(c) 
control air leakage, 
 
(d) resist the ingress of insects and vermin, 
 
(e) 
where required, resist forced entry, and 
 
(f) 
are easily operable when not intended to be fixed. 
(2) Skylights and their components shall be designed, constructed and installed so that, when in the closed position, they 
resist snow loads. 
(3) Main entrance doors and their components shall be designed, constructed and installed so that, when in the closed 
position, they 
 
(a) 
control air leakage, 
 
(b) resist the ingress of insects and vermin, 
 
(c) 
resist forced entry, and 
 
(d) are easily operable. 
(4) Storm doors, sliding doors and their components shall be designed, constructed and installed so that, when in the 
closed position, they 
 
(a) 
resist wind loads, 
 
(b) control air leakage to a minimum allowable 5 m3h/m and a maximum allowable 8.35 m3h/m, 
 
(c) 
resist the ingress of insects and vermin, and 
 
(d) are easily operable. 
(5) Compliance with the performance requirements described in Sentences (1) to (4) shall be demonstrated by 
 
(a) 
complying with the requirements in 
 
(i) Subsection 9.7.4. or 9.7.5., and 
 
(ii) Subsection 9.7.6., or 
 
(b) design and construction conforming to Part 5. 
9.7.3.2. 
Heat Transfer Performance
(1) Windows, doors and skylights described in Clause 9.7.1.1.(1)(a) and their components shall be designed, 
constructed and installed to 
 
(a) 
minimize surface condensation on the warm side of the component, and  (See Note A-9.7.3.2.(1)(a)) 
 
(b) ensure comfortable conditions for occupants. 
(2) Compliance with the heat transfer performance requirements described in Sentence (1) shall be demonstrated by 
 
(a) 
complying with the requirements in Article 9.7.3.3., or 
 
(b) design and construction conforming to Part 5. 
 
9.7.3.3. 
Thermal Characteristics of Windows, Doors and Skylights 
(1) Metal frames and sash of windows, doors and skylights shall incorporate a thermal break.

(2) Windows and doors described in Sentence (1) do not require a thermal break where they are installed as 
 
(a) 
vehicular access doors, 
 
(b) storm windows and doors, or 
 
(c) 
windows and doors that are required to have a fire-resistance rating. 
(3) Windows, doors and skylights with or without storm doors or sash that are installed in buildings where the intended 
use of the interior space will not result in high moisture generation shall have a maximum thermal transmittance (U-
value) or minimum temperature index (I) in accordance with Table 9.7.3.3. 
(4) Windows, doors and skylights, with or without storm doors or sash that are installed in portions of buildings where 
the intended use of the interior space will result in high moisture generation shall be designed in conformance with 
Subsection 5.3.  (See Note A-9.25.5.2.)

Notes to Table 9.7.3.3.: 
(1) U-values for specific products can be determined according to measures referenced in AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440,  
"NAFS - North American Fenestration Standard/Specification for windows, doors, and skylights."  Temperature index (I) is determined 
according to the physical test procedure given in CSA A440.2/A440.3, "Fenestration energy performance/User guide to CSA A440.2-
19, Fenestration energy performance." 
(2) There is no appropriate test procedure available for testing the condensation resistance of sloped glazing. 
(3) Where the U-value in this Table differs from the U-value provided in MMA Supplementary Standard SB-10, "Energy Efficiency 
Requirements" or MMA Supplementary Standard SB-12, "Energy Efficiency for Housing", the most restrictive U-value shall apply.
